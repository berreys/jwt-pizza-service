## Docker
I want to learn more about Docker.

### What is docker?
#### From class materials:
Docker is the "original proponent of container technology".
Docker uses Linux namespaces to essentially take a snapshot of the application and allow it to be executed on any compliant machine with the exact same environment.
This snapshot is consists of the changes between the application and the OS the application is running on. This allows the snapshot (or container image) to be much smaller than the entire OS. The image can then be downloaded and executed on other machines with the same OS.

### When is docker used?
### What are its benefits?
